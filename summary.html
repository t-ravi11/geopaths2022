        <h1>Summary</h1>

        <p class="analysistext">The soil nails increased the factor of safety by a significant amount in our
        examples. Applying the same mitigation strategy to the Oso Landslide, we believe
        that the FS would increase. In the first Oso Landslide example, the FS was 0.78.
        Addition of soil nails to the slope could have been the increase in resisting force
        needed to push the FS to over 1.
        </p>

        <h4>Why does this matter?</h4>

        <p class="analysistext">By understanding landslides and their failure mechanisms through the
            use of computational modeling, scientists and engineers can better characterize and potentially
            predict slope failure and therefore prevent property damage, loss to human life, and economic
            impact. In addition, by understanding how various mitigation strategies like soil nails
            affect slope stability, we can use these strategies to reduce risk and vulnerability to
            landslide hazards.
